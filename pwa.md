# Progressive Web Application (PWA)

Kianda is a progressive web application. This means with Kianda you get a digital experience that is  native like while maintaining online web benefits.  

> *Access your digital workspace PWA by going to https://&lt;businessName&gt;.kianda.com*

There are several benefits of using a PWA app when comparing to a web app or even a native only app.

- **Reliable** - *Apps keep working with or without network access. Even when your users are going though a tunnel in a lift changes are automatically queued offline then synchronised when connectivity is restored*
- **Fast** - App loads quickly thanks having the app installed locally, app resources are available offline
- **Engaging** - When installed on your home screen with your own brand icons users receive timely push notifications that help them stay engaged
