Connecting to data in Kianda is a breeze. Quickly add a shared data connector that can be displayed in forms or dashboards.

Kianda comes with a pre-defined set of data-connectors. A few of them are Office 365, SharePoint, Salesforce, DocuSign, SAP and more. 

However, using SOAP or REST service you could easily connect with a data source that doesn't exist in our pre-defined list.
