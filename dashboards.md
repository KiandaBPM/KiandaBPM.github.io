## Real-time process monitoring

Kianda offers real-time monitoring over mobile, tablet or desktop using dashboards. Using Kianda dashboards, you could easily configure a process dashboard or home page in minutes with the help of widgets. Kianda comes with a pre-defined set of widgets as below:

1. **Rich text**: The Rich text is used to display some texts, links or images on the dashboards.
2. **Tile**: A tile is used to display a count of instances with different colour schemes. You could also add conditions to display count, for example, you could add a condition "Status" equals "In-progress", this will display the count of instances with status "In-progress".
3. **Chart:** Using a chart widget, you could create a pie chart, bar chart or a line chart. These charts could be used to represent various conditions on a process.
4. **List:** The list widget displays the instances of the selected process. List widget could also be used to connect with any other widget to display the filtered items.
5. **Filter:** The filter widget is used to filter the instances based on a field. For example, process instances could be filtered by status.
6. **Link:** The link widget is used to add a link to a new process, dashboard or any external sources such as SharePoint.
7. **Walk-through:** This widget allows you to create a walk-through quickly which could be made available to a user, group or an organisation.

For example, this can benefit businesses where users can carry out inspections or maintenance even at a remote location with no access to the internet. The user can create a new instance or carry out actions on an existing instance.
